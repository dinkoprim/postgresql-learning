# PostgreSQL Learning Project

This project is designed to help you learn and practice PostgreSQL through a series of exercises. Each exercise focuses on different aspects of SQL and database management.

## Project Structure

- **exercises/**: Contains SQL files for each exercise.
  - `exercise1.sql`: Basic queries and operations.
  - `exercise2.sql`: More complex queries and database operations.
  - `exercise3.sql`: Advanced topics and features in PostgreSQL.

- **scripts/**: Contains setup and teardown scripts.
  - `setup.sql`: SQL commands to set up the database schema and initial data.
  - `teardown.sql`: SQL commands to clean up the database after exercises.

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
